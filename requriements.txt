Directory storage stucture:
The file is saved in the following way if the file approval type is by part:
folder_name-->normalized_name --> compilance --> manufacturer_component number(component table) -->file(if bypart)
                                    |
                                    |--> blanket --> file(if blanket)
                                    |
                                    |--> partseries --> file(if partseries)
                                    |
                                    |--> multiplebyparts --> file(if bypart mapped to same manufacturer but multiple components)
atom_mfr_docs\compilance\Feuerherdt_REACH.pdf
            
if the file is mappedd to multiple manufacturers but approval type is by part then the file is stored in the following manner:
folder_name(root folder)-->compilance(directory) --> file(bypart but mapped to multiple manufacturers)
